# HyperAir
Welcome to HyperAir, Pilot! Navigate four amazingly controlled [Bombardier](https://bombardier.com/en/our-jets) jets through various weather (and space for some reason, i swear i didn't implement that on purpose, it was a "typo") for an endless amount of time. <br />
impressive, huh? <br />

# Instructions!
1. ## Install Python 3 if you haven't already. (any version of python3 is alright)
2. ## Installation
    #### Short Explanation - if you've done this kind of thing before
    - Head to [releases](https://github.com/HyperSourceGithub/hyperair/releases), install the latest release, and unpack/extract it.
    #### Long Explanation - if you're new to this
    - Go to the releases page (https://github.com/HyperSourceGithub/hyperair/releases) and download the latest version as a .zip file **(Source Code (zip))**. <br />
    - Open the .zip file, and extract all the files. This is done automatically on Mac, and can be done on Windows by clicking **"extract all"** in the top bar. If you need help, I've done you a favor and searched it for you: [Mac](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+extract+files+from+a+zip+macos&oq=how+to+extract+files+from+a+zip+macos) | [Windows](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+extract+files+from+a+zip+windows) <br />
3. ## Run the game
    #### Short Explanation
    - Run `main.py` as you would a normal python program.
    #### Long Explanation
    - Find this new folder created (not the .zip) and locate the file `main.py`. <br />
    - Get the file path:
        - Mac: **Right-click** the file, hold down **option** (or **alt** if your keyboard doesn't have it) and click **"Copy "main.py" as pathname"** or something similar. <br />
        - Windows: **Right-click** the file and click **"Copy as path"**.
    - Run the file by opening your **terminal** (Mac) or **command prompt/PowerShell** (Windows) and typing `python3 <paste the path of the file by using ctrl-v or shift-ctrl-v>`.
    - Or alternatively, just open it in an IDE such as PyCharm or Visual Studio Code and run it as normal.
4. ## Play!
